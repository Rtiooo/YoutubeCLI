All of us have probably experienced the horrors beyond human comprehension that come with a classic Youtube session, so what do you say if, by taking this nigh infinite potential of the platform, while getting rid of all the fluff, we use it in the way it’s always been intended – running the entire thing from your terminal, no fancy useless UI, no fancy useless features and even no fancy useless graphics.

By combining the powers of the official Youtube API, the ever-dependable Python and the ingenuity (ahem) of yours truly, I try to get the entirety of the Youtube experience running in a terminal, in such a way that no matter the environment, you'll get to experience the platform in its most adequate form.
